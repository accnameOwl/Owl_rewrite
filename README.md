### What has been done so far

I have been working hard to learn as much as i can. I am by no means any good programmer so this has been a journey of experiences. I started a year a go with this project, and it was a casual learning project. It gradually evolved and i started to see so many aspects where i could improve the code. So i took my time to rewrite the project concept.
